# freemind-refined

As of Feb 2021, original FreeMind is still useful and works good on latest Java. However it looks that development is stopped.

## Goals

- Create native installers with current JRE included with jpackage
- Update third-party libraries to latest possible versions
- Omit functionality which looks unused and unnecessary
- Maybe trivial refactoring if needed
- Maybe fix trivial issues if found

## Non-goals

- Maintain original codebase
- Fix issues
- Add new features
