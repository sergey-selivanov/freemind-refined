# freemind-refined

As of Feb 2021, original FreeMind is still useful and works good on latest Java. However it looks there is no active development.

## Version

This is FreeMind 1.0.1. Latest 1.1.0 beta versions use modifiled mindmap file format but I want to keep compatibility with existing mindmap files.

## Goals

- Create native self-sufficient installers including latest JRE (jpackage)
- Update third-party libraries to latest versions as possible
- Omit functionality which looks unused, obsolete, unnecessary (database, jabber, maps etc.)
- Maybe trivial refactoring if needed
- Maybe fix trivial issues if found

## Non-goals

- Maintain original code
- Fix issues in original code
- Add new features
